**VITA-E: Natural Human-Robot Interaction with Concurrent Seeing, Hearing, Speaking, and Acting**

## About

VITA-E breaks through the rigid interaction paradigm of current Vision-Language-Action models with a dual-model architecture that enables robots to simultaneously see, hear, speak, and act while handling real-time user interruptionsâ€”mimicking human-like multitasking. Demonstrated on physical humanoid robots with 100% success rates on critical interruption tasks, VITA-E represents a fundamental leap toward natural, responsive robotic assistants that truly collaborate with humans in complex, dynamic scenarios.
